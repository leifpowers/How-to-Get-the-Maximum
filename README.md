How to Get the Maximum Issues and Repository

This is an experiment in communal, scalable CRM. I wasn't super keen on hosting everything under the sun on the main website - it's going to get pwned as it is. I was pretty horrified by the per-capita complexity and resource burden of hosting merely the trouble ticket tools. 

Once you create a free account on github, you can log issues in this repository against the main website. I can then interact with you to resolve.

I'm also thinking about using the git repository to hold files that make sense for multiple people to edit; but I have no immediate plans there.

How to Get the Maximum Issues and Repository

This is an experiment in communal, scalable CRM. I wasn't super keen on hosting everything under the sun on the main website - it's going to get pwned as it is. I was pretty horrified by the per-capita complexity and resource burden of hosting merely the trouble ticket tools. 

Once you create a free account on github, you can log issues in this repository against the main website. I can then interact with you to resolve.

For now, the license of everything that is posted is PUBLIC DOMAIN. Link to something if you don't want to risk me taking what you posted and pushing it right into my documents. 

I'm also thinking about using the git repository to hold files that make sense for multiple people to edit.
